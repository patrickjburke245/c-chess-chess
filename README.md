Phases

1. [COMPLETE] Working, printable chess board.

Start following chess moves/rules.
2. [COMPLETE] Need a for-loop/algorithm to move a P1 pawn down/south.

3. [COMPLETE] Need to print out somewhat algebraic notation for chess board: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_%28chess%29

4. [COMPLETE] Table needs a method to move a P1 pawn down/south.

5. [COMPLETE] Take a text input, convert it to board coordinates

5. We need a turn attribute.. based off if piece ends with 1 or 2??

6. Table needs a way to move pawns down indefinitely, not just to row 3.

7. must accept user input for which pawn they'd like to move


ideas:
5. We need to implement turns
