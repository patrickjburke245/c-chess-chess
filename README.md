##My Chess Game

Do not use in production. For personal learning only

##Phases

1. [COMPLETE] Working, printable chess board.

Start following chess moves/rules.
2. [COMPLETE] Need a for-loop/algorithm to move a P1 pawn down/south.

3. [COMPLETE] Need to print out somewhat algebraic notation for chess board: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_%28chess%29

4. [COMPLETE] Table needs a method to move a P1 pawn down/south.

5. [COMPLETE] Take a text input, convert it to board coordinates

6. Allow a player to re-do a turn if they attempt something not allowed.

5. We need a turn attribute.. based off if piece ends with 1 or 2??

6. Table needs a way to move pawns down indefinitely, not just to row 3.

7. must accept user input for which pawn they'd like to move

8. make sure you can't put the game in a sped-up loop by pressing up-arrow then hitting enter.


ideas:
5. We need to implement turns
