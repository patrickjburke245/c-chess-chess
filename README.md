## My Chess Game

Do not use in production. For personal learning only

## Project Phases

1. [COMPLETE] Working, printable chess board.

Start following chess moves/rules.
2. [COMPLETE] Need a for-loop/algorithm to move a P1 pawn down/south.

3. [COMPLETE] Need to print out somewhat algebraic notation for chess board (along with chess board): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_%28chess%29

4. [COMPLETE] Table needs a method to implement algorithm (move a P1 pawn down/south).

5. [COMPLETE] Take a text input, convert it to board coordinates

6. Allow a player to re-do a turn if they attempt an illegal move.

7. Implement player-based turns based off if piece ends with 1 or 2?

8. Table needs a way to move pawns down indefinitely, not just to row 3.

9. Must accept user input for which pawn they'd like to move

10. Bug control: Make sure player can't put the game in a sped-up loop by pressing up-arrow then hitting enter.
